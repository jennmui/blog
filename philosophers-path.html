<strong>Kyoto, Japan - The Philosopher&#39;s Walk</strong><br>
February, 2015 | Posted: 4/16/15<br><br>

The philosopher&#39;s walk is a pathway between 2 temples: Ginkaku-ji and Nanzen-ji in Kyoto. It takes about 30 minutes to walk from beginning to end without any stops. It&#39;s lined with cherry blossom trees the entire way and passes several temples/shrines from beginning to end. Using the power of wikipedia, I found a little more about the history of the philosopher&#39;s path: <br><br>

<i>
&#39;The route is so-named because the influential 20th-century Japanese philosopher and Kyoto University professor Nishida Kitaro is thought to have used it for daily meditation.&#39; <br><br>
</i>

We decided to tackle the walk on our last day in Kyoto hoping to catch the blossom flowers blooming. Unfortunately, we were just about a week or so too early for cherry blossom season so we didn&#39;t see the path in its full glory. Regardless, the walk was scenic and enjoyable. For our walk, we decided to start at Ginkaku-ji, which is the north end of the path. <br><br>

Ginkaku-ji is also known as the Silver Pavilion and is on the east side of Kyoto, opposite of Kinkaku-ji, the Golden Pavilion, which is located on the west side of Kyoto. Unlike Kinkaku-ji (which is made of gold), however, Ginkaku-ji is actually not made of silver. Apparently, there were plans to cover the temple in silver foil but they never came to realization. Beyond the Ginkaku-ji entrance, there&#39;s a pretty garden area that you can walk around. We saw one of the workers there planting a tree! <br><br>

Along the philosopher&#39;s path, we also saw Jizo stones! They&#39;re stones/statues of the Buddhist deity, Jizo, protector of the children, women, and travelers. <br><br>

We were pretty tired by the time we reached the end to Nanzen-ji because we stopped so often. Nanzen-ji had some cool things to offer though, like the big aqueduct outside of the temple. Inside the temple itself, there were different rooms where you could look inside (but you weren&#39;t allowed inside) and check out old Japanese artwork on the walls. We weren&#39;t allowed to take any pictures of the artwork so you&#39;ll have to check it out yourself if you ever find yourself in Kyoto (which I highly recommend, if you haven&#39;t been). <br><br>
