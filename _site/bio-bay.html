<strong>Vieques and the Bioluminescent Bay, Puerto Rico </strong><br>
July, 2013 | Posted: 4/20/15<br><br>

During the summer of 2013, I was presented with a unique opportunity to work at a STEM/Lego NXT robotics camp in San Juan, Puerto Rico for 2 weeks.The name of the camp is <a href="http://www.campeureka.com/">Camp Eureka</a> - check them out because they&rsquo;re awesome. Being both an advocate for STEM education and someone who loves to visit new places, I couldn&rsquo;t help but accept the offer.<br>
<br>
During my 2 weeks in Puerto Rico, I spent my weekday mornings teaching six and seven year olds how to program SCRATCH. Outside of the classroom, I (along with my fellow teachers) explored the island. One of the coolest things I did in Puerto Rico, though, actually happened in Vieques, a smaller island-municipality east of the main island. Vieques is only a short ferry ride away from the Farjardo Ferry Terminal and happens to have one of five Bioluminescent Bays in Puerto Rico, Mosquito Bay (named so because of the ridiculous amounts of mosquitos present before actually entering the bay). <br>

<br>
Now if you don&rsquo;t know what a bioluminescent bay is, you&rsquo;re in for a treat. These bays are filled with micro-organisms (called dinoflagellate, if you&rsquo;re interested) that, when moved, GLOW. Let me reiterate: <b>THE WATER GLOWS.</b> This means you can often catch glimpses of light because of fish swimming past you. I can&rsquo;t attest to how awesome the other bio bays are in Puerto Rico, but the Mosquito Bay is amazing (I&rsquo;ve also heard that it&rsquo;s the best one in Puerto Rico). If you can, try and schedule to see the Bio Bay when there&rsquo;s no moon out. We were only able to go on a somewhat-cloudy-but-still-a-full-moon-day and I was still blown away. We kayaked into the bay with one of the local tour groups in Vieques (there are quite a few) but electric boats are also an option if you&rsquo;re not feeling kayaking. Unfortunately, I have no pictures because I didn&rsquo;t want to bring my camera into the water but a quick google search will show you how pretty this bays is.<br>
<br>
Prior to going into the bay, we were told that we wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to swim in it because it was against regulation. We were also told that there are quite a few jellyfish in the bay and we would risk getting stung. Our tour guide (who I think was somewhat drunk, which was hilarious) told us that there&rsquo;s only an extremely small chance that you&rsquo;ll get stung by a jellyfish and encouraged us to swim. So, of course we did. When else would you ever get the chance to swim in a bay that literally glows while you move around in it? <br>
<br>
After maybe about 10 or 15 minutes of swimming around, one of us (out of our six person group) got stung. Within another minute, two more got attacked by jellyfish. So, we scrambled back into our kayaks and just enjoyed the rest of the tour safely in our boats. We found out from some locals later that night that something like 80% of the people who swim into the water get stung. Ultimately, if you do go (and your tour guide is drunk and doesn&rsquo;t really care), it&rsquo;s up to you whether or not you want to take the risk. <br>
<br>
A side note: if you are planning on going to Mosquito Bay, you&rsquo;ll have to spend the night in Vieques because the ferry that goes back to the main island stops running fairly early in the night. So enjoy the night life after getting back from the Bay! If you&rsquo;re dead set on not staying in Vieques, flying out of the Vieques airport back to the main island is always an option.<br>
