<strong>Vieques and the Bioluminescent Bay, Puerto Rico </strong><br>
July, 2013 | Posted: 4/20/15<br><br>

During the summer of 2013, I was presented with a unique opportunity to work at a STEM/Lego NXT robotics camp in San Juan, Puerto Rico for 2 weeks.The name of the camp is <a href="http://www.campeureka.com/">Camp Eureka</a> - check them out because they&rsquo;re awesome. Being both an advocate for STEM education and someone who loves to visit new places, I couldn&rsquo;t help but accept the offer.<br>
<br>
During my 2 weeks in Puerto Rico, I spent my weekday mornings teaching six and seven year olds how to program SCRATCH. Outside of the classroom, I (along with my fellow teachers) explored the island. One of the coolest things I did in Puerto Rico, though, actually happened in Vieques, a smaller island-municipality east of the main island. Vieques is only a short ferry ride away from the Farjardo Ferry Terminal and happens to have one of five Bioluminescent Bays in Puerto Rico, Mosquito Bay (named so because of the ridiculous amounts of mosquitos present before actually entering the bay)... <br>

	<strong>Kyoto, Japan - The Philosopher&#39;s Walk</strong><br>
	
February, 2015 | Posted: 4/16/15 <br><br>

The philosopher&#39;s walk is a pathway between 2 temples: Ginkaku-ji and Nanzen-ji in Kyoto. It takes about 30 minutes to walk from beginning to end without any stops. It&#39;s lined with cherry blossom trees the entire way and passes several temples/shrines from beginning to end. Using the power of wikipedia, I found a little more about the history of the philosopher&#39;s path... <br><br>
