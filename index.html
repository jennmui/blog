<strong>Zip-lining over Monteverde, Costa Rica</strong><br>
February, 2008 | Posted: 5/6/2015<br><br>

The mantra of Costa Rica, in all of its glorious essence, is the phrase <i>Pura Vida</i>. <i>Pura Vida</i> means pure life and it is the most common expression you will hear in Costa Rica. The words can be used as a welcoming hello or a synonym to describe something wonderful. <i>Pura Vida</i> also alludes to the wildlife preservation efforts and natural ecosystems in Costa Rica.<br>
<br>
Monteverde, a small town in the Puntarenas province, very much embodies these words. It is home to an extremely diverse population of plants, mammals, reptiles, and insects residing in its Cloud Forest Reserve - a naturalist&rsquo;s paradise. Suffice to say, there is a lot of beautiful stuff to see in Monteverde with all of its natural landmarks. It is even cooler when you are looking at it from a bird&rsquo;s eye view - which brings me to the subject of zip-lining. <br><br>

<strong>Vieques and the Bioluminescent Bay, Puerto Rico </strong><br>
July, 2013 | Posted: 4/20/15<br><br>

During the summer of 2013, I was presented with a unique opportunity to work at a STEM/Lego NXT robotics camp in San Juan, Puerto Rico for 2 weeks.The name of the camp is <a href="http://www.campeureka.com/">Camp Eureka</a> - check them out because they&rsquo;re awesome. Being both an advocate for STEM education and someone who loves to visit new places, I couldn&rsquo;t help but accept the offer.<br>
<br>
During my 2 weeks in Puerto Rico, I spent my weekday mornings teaching six and seven year olds how to program SCRATCH. Outside of the classroom, I (along with my fellow teachers) explored the island. One of the coolest things I did in Puerto Rico, though, actually happened in Vieques, a smaller island-municipality east of the main island. Vieques is only a short ferry ride away from the Farjardo Ferry Terminal and happens to have one of five Bioluminescent Bays in Puerto Rico, Mosquito Bay (named so because of the ridiculous amounts of mosquitos present before actually entering the bay)... <br>

	<strong>Kyoto, Japan - The Philosopher&#39;s Walk</strong><br>
	
February, 2015 | Posted: 4/16/15 <br><br>

The philosopher&#39;s walk is a pathway between 2 temples: Ginkaku-ji and Nanzen-ji in Kyoto. It takes about 30 minutes to walk from beginning to end without any stops. It&#39;s lined with cherry blossom trees the entire way and passes several temples/shrines from beginning to end. Using the power of wikipedia, I found a little more about the history of the philosopher&#39;s path... <br><br>
